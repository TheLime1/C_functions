### explain <ins>insertion</ins> sort to a 3rd grader with an example

Sure! Here is a simple explanation of insertion sort that a 3rd grader might understand:

Imagine that you have a bunch of cards with numbers written on them. You want to arrange the cards in numerical order from least to greatest. One way to do this is to use the "insertion sort" method. Here's how it works:

Take the first card and set it aside. This is your "sorted" pile.
Take the second card and compare it to the first card. If it is less than the first card, put it in front of the first card. If it is greater than the first card, put it after the first card.
Take the third card and compare it to the cards in your "sorted" pile. If it is less than the first card, put it in front of the first card. If it is greater than the first card but less than the second card, put it between the first and second cards. If it is greater than the second card, put it after the second card.
Repeat this process for each card in the pile until all of the cards are in the "sorted" pile.
Here's an example:

Original pile: [5, 2, 4, 1, 3]

1st iteration: [2, 5], [4, 1, 3]
2nd iteration: [1, 2, 5], [3, 4]
3rd iteration: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

Sorted pile: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

### explain <ins>bubble</ins> sort to a 3rd grader with an example

Sure! Here is a simple explanation of bubble sort that a 3rd grader might understand:

Imagine that you have a bunch of cards with numbers written on them. You want to arrange the cards in numerical order from least to greatest. One way to do this is to use the "bubble sort" method. Here's how it works:

Take the first two cards and compare them. If the first card is greater than the second card, swap them. If the first card is less than the second card, leave them as they are.
Take the second and third cards and compare them. If the second card is greater than the third card, swap them. If the second card is less than the third card, leave them as they are.
Repeat this process for each pair of cards until you reach the end of the pile.
Start again at the beginning of the pile and repeat the process until no more swaps are needed.
Here's an example:

Original pile: [5, 2, 4, 1, 3]

1st iteration: [2, 4, 1, 3, 5]
2nd iteration: [2, 1, 3, 4, 5]
3rd iteration: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

Sorted pile: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

### explain <ins>selection</ins> sort to a 3rd grader with an example

Sure! Here is a simple explanation of selection sort that a 3rd grader might understand:

Imagine that you have a bunch of cards with numbers written on them. You want to arrange the cards in numerical order from least to greatest. One way to do this is to use the "selection sort" method. Here's how it works:

Take the first card and set it aside. This is your "sorted" pile.
Take the second card and compare it to the remaining cards. Find the card with the lowest number and set it aside.
Take the third card and compare it to the remaining cards. Find the card with the lowest number and set it aside.
Repeat this process for each card until all of the cards are in the "sorted" pile.
Here's an example:

Original pile: [5, 2, 4, 1, 3]

1st iteration: [2], [5, 4, 1, 3]
2nd iteration: [1, 2], [5, 4, 3]
3rd iteration: [1, 2, 3], [5, 4]
4th iteration: [1, 2, 3, 4], [5]
5th iteration: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

Sorted pile: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
